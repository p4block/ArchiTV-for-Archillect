# ArchiTV — Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2 November 2025

## 1) Who we are
- **App:** ArchiTV
- **Developer/Controller:** *linuxct*
- **Contact:** *architv@linuxct.space*

## 2) What the app does
ArchiTV is a simple Android application that displays the Archillect “TV” experience inside a standard Android WebView. It has no account system, no analytics, no advertising, and no in-app purchases.

## 3) Data we collect
**We do not collect, store, share, or sell any personal data.**
- No identifiers (e.g., device ID, advertising ID)
- No analytics/telemetry SDKs
- No crash reporting tied to individuals
- No server-side logs linked to a user

## 4) Permissions
- **INTERNET** — required solely to load Archillect content.
No other runtime permissions are requested. If a future version requires additional permissions or features, this policy will be updated before release.

## 5) Third-party content and WebView
The app loads content from **Archillect (archillect.com)** and assets that site serves (images, scripts, CDNs). Those third-party services may process data typical of web requests (e.g., IP address, user-agent, cookies set by their site).
- We **do not control** and **cannot access** third-party cookies or trackers set by those sites from within our app.
- If you follow links that leave Archillect, those destinations have their own privacy practices. Please review their policies.

## 6) Children’s privacy
ArchiTV targets a general audience and does not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## 7) Security
ArchiTV does not maintain servers for this app and does not store user data. Network traffic is handled by the Android WebView component using the platform’s transport security.

## 8) Data retention
Not applicable. We do not collect or retain personal data.

## 9) International transfers
Not applicable to us (we do not process personal data). Any transfers performed by third-party websites you view in the WebView are governed by those parties’ policies.

## 10) Your rights
Because we do not collect personal data, there is nothing for us to access, correct, delete, or export. If you contact us, we will only use the information you provide to address your inquiry and then delete it once it’s no longer needed.

## 11) Changes to this policy
If the app ever adds analytics, ads, accounts, or otherwise begins collecting data, we will update this policy and our store listing **before** releasing such changes.
